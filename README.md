A script hub for many different things.
Credit to:
Unbeatable for teaching me how to make this.
Otion Library
Visual Studio Code, which allowed me to program in the web.
And lastly, github, for making it only take one line to initiate my script.
`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MetaMysteries8/Metascripter-Roblox/main/source'))()`

Another version exists that runs with a different gui system.
